## Description:
<p> This is a restaurent page project using javascript. All the DOM elements in this project are dynamically created using javascript. It has three pages which are home page, menu page and contact page. It uses tabbed browsing to access the pages. That was something interesting I learned while doing this project. I learned how to use webpack,how to incorporate tabbed browsing in the page which made the project worth doing. <p>
